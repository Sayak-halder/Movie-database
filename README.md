A frontend for comprehensive web database for movies, integrating data from The Movie Database (**TMDb**) API. This database allows users to search for movies based on various criteria, receive similarity recommendations, and explore trending, top-rated, and upcoming movies. The user interface is designed for intuitive navigation, enhancing the user experience. Implemented using a robust technology stack, including programming languages, frameworks, and databases, the project overcame challenges in data integration and performance optimization. 

Future enhancements aim to include user accounts for personalized recommendations and expand the database with more metadata. Ultimately, this database serves as a valuable platform for movie enthusiasts to discover and explore a wide range of films.
